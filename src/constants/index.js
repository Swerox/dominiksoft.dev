export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I'm Dominik :). I'm 20 years old. I’m a passionate programmer from Germany with a love for crafting innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. As a trainee in IT for a leading automotive company, I dive into Python, React, and JavaScript, creating sleek applications and tackling backend challenges with databases. Recently, I’ve ventured into the Mac ecosystem, embracing its power for development and creativity. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me gaming, brainstorming new ideas, or leveling up my skills to turn exciting concepts into reality. Let’s build something awesome together!
